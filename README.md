#### The Problem of Meme Creator Ecosysterm

**Lack of Benefit for meme devs**

Pump.fun generated over $100 million in revenue in the past year, but creators earned less than $2 million.

Compared to the thriving NFT market, these numbers are quite disheartening. Over the past year, NFT markets have distributed more than $100 million to creators, equivalent to the platform’s revenue. The current memecoin creator ecosystem is not like this.

One major reason of memecoin rug pulls or “rat trading” is that developers find it difficult to profit in other ways.

**ignorance the content aspect of memecoin**

Beyond being an asset, memecoin has strong entertainment value. It represents a new form of content.

With new forms of content comes a new creator economy. This content needs to be distributed more effectively, rather than just being ranked and combined based on trading volume. 

#### How Meme4Fun solve it


The first problem is actually easy to solve. As a memecoin platform, as long as we are not too greedy, we can simply distribute 50% of the transaction fees to users.

More importantly, we want to build a healthy community. Therefore, we will issue a platform token called “Fun.” Any user who trades or creates tokens on meme4fun will receive Fun tokens. Having fun should be easy!

The remaining 50% of the transaction fees will be fairly distributed to the holders of the Fun token.


We believe the second problem can be solved with a new content recommendation algorithm. Each address corresponds to different content and trading preferences. Additionally, each memecoin has different tags during its creation process. For instance, in our new curve model, users can select low, medium, or high fundraising targets when creating their tokens, which will correspond to different user preferences.

Our ultimate goal is to build an on-chain TikTok.
